// synchronous  = Executes line by line consecutively in a sequential manner
//                             Code that waits for an operation to complete.

// asynchronous = Allows multiple operations to be performed concurrently without waiting
//                              Doesn't block the execution flow and allows the program to continue
//                             (I/O operations, network requests, fetching data)
//                             Handled with: Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await
